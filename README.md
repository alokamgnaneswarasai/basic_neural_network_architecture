# Basic Neural Network Architecture using PyTorch

This repository contains a basic implementation of a neural network using PyTorch. The architecture consists of an input layer with 10 neurons, a hidden layer with 100 neurons using the sigmoid activation function, and an output layer with 10 neurons using the softmax activation function.

## Neural Network Architecture

- **Input Layer:** 10 neurons
- **Hidden Layer:** 100 neurons with Sigmoid activation
- **Output Layer:** 10 neurons with Softmax activation

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are organized as follows:

- **`basicnn.ipynb`**: Contains the implementation of the neural network architecture.
